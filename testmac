# Take note of the changes here - Histograms are now added differently.
# To add a histogram, you need to specify everything about it, then call /SDMessenger/addHist <name>
# Same rules apply about the centre of the histogram, and now Iâ€™m pretty confident the penumbra works, but you should check
# There is a new command, /SDMessenger/setType which allows you to select the type of histogram to use. 0 is for depth-dose, 1 for depth-LET, 2 for penumbra-dose and 3 for penumbra-LET
